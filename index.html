    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Pittsburgh in 2023, where I was advised by Dr. Liang Zhan.
       My research focuses on medical image computing, interpretable and robust artificial intelligence, graph learning, and neuroimaging-genetic analysis of brain diseases.</p>

    <h2>Research Projects</h2>

    <div class="project">
      <strong>A. Neuroimaging-Genetic + AI + Brain Diseases</strong>
      <p>We are dedicated to advancing the study of brain diseases through the development of cutting-edge AI algorithms that integrate large-scale neuroimaging data, multimodal brain connectomics, and genetic profiles. By bridging neuroimaging and imaging-genetics with artificial intelligence, my research aims to enable early diagnosis, identify novel biomarkers, uncover genotype–phenotype associations, and explore the complex relationships between brain disorders and clinical phenotypes. This integrative, data-driven approach supports the goals of precision medicine and deepens our understanding of neurological and psychiatric conditions at both the molecular and systems levels.</p>
      <p><strong>Support:</strong> 1. UTRGV Presidential Research Fellowship(2023-2025); 2. The UTRGV Faculty Seed Grant(2023-2024)</p>
      <p><strong>Principal investigator:</strong> Haoteng Tang
    </div>

    <div class="project">
      <strong>B. Medical Image Computing</strong>
      <p>We develop novel AI algorithms—including deep neural networks and large foundation models—to address advanced challenges in medical image analysis across various organs. Our work focuses on tasks such as image segmentation, image quality enhancement, multimodal image fusion, and the estimation of clinical measures from imaging data.</p>

    <div class="project">
      <strong>C. Interpretable and Trusthworthy AI</strong>
      <p>We are committed to developing interpretable and trustworthy AI models that support reliable decision-making in medical imaging. Our work focuses on integrating model transparency, uncertainty quantification, and clinically meaningful explanations into the design of deep learning and foundation model architectures. Our goal is to ensure that AI-driven insights are not only accurate but also interpretable and actionable for clinicians.</p>
